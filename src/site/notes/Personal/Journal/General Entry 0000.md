In this month, I've read a lot more than I did in the previous year. I'm feeling content about it.

Nothing much is happening in my life right now. Works are being done in the most earnest manner I can master. I'm not totally happy though. Still I get angry by seeing bad code.

The month is ending and I'm looking forward to the next month (Why? Salary maybe.), and the delivery of my e-reader about what I'm very much skeptical.
